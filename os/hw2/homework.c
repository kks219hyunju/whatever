-- arg1 "name of the file"
-- arg2 "delay of each line"

The following program is to take first argument from the user
and read each line of the file given by the user and
print out the line in reverse. The second argument is
the delay between printing of each line. By using "sleep"
function, the program is able to delay the printing of each line
before outputing next reserved line.
